# **Italian Restaurant Mercato** 

> #### _Cathy and Victor opened the restaurant in 2005, encouraged by their son Dominic. Before long Mercato Mission would soon add a full-service restaurant, instantly transforming the culinary scene on Calgary’s 4th street. Hard work, fierce passion and unmatched quality is what’s set Mercato apart for 46 years._

## **Visual Hierarchy**
### The principle of arranging and placing elements or contents on an website can show their order of importance and intentions. Laying out elements logically and strategically can influence users and guide them to desire actions. The first page of their website is showing their restaurant image through a customer's point of view as if you are inside. It shows and delivers the scale of the restaurant and hints at their cozy interiors. After the image, the way they are informing customers that their business is open in big bold font gives very welcoming feelings.

### The goal of this website is telling customers who they are, what they can provide, and how people can find them. By doing this, it brings in new customers and allows them to continue their business again after the effects of COVID-19. Underneath the business hour information, they added their philosophy of the company and by doing so it shows how authentic and genuine they are towards their business and it keeps them different and unique compared to any other Italian restaurant. This can help people to have good expectations of their service a little more before their visit. If you scroll down more, you can find all of their pick-up and dine-in menu with couple more pictures.

### Overall this website provides enough information to bring more customers into their business. However there are a few things they could change to make their website more effective in visual hierarchy for better usability.

- **image size** - the image you see on the first page gives people idea of what to expect but the size of this image is so big and wide that it takes away too much space. Therefore, it makes viewers scroll down further to find the actual information. In mobile, the pictures are much more compact in size and that helps the viewers to easily scroll down to their menu page.

- **small navigation tabs** - the tab options on the top right corner is very small in font compared to the image they provide in the first page. It is not visually pleasing since the ratio of those two are not flowing together. Because the image is so wide, the navigation tab has to be in the right corner rather than in the middle.

- **different font** - above the make a reservation button, there is quote "When you order from Mercato, you're like family.". Oddly this quote is in different font compared to any other content they carry on their website. This feature crushes their aesthetic and flow instead of adding an impact or difference since those two fonts are very different in style.

## **Mental Models and Usability**

### Mental models are what is already built in a user's brain and people reference that to make their step easier and faster by referring to what they already know and saw from their past interactions. It is one of the most important concepts in human computer interaction. Friendly mental models can increase in usability of a website and it leads to a more efficient and satisfying visitors experience.

### The restaurant logo on the top left corner when you first open the website is white in color while the background of their website is also white. There is almost no contrast between them and the viewers would less likely to recognize their logo/name. Finding their menu is also little bit of work since there is no menu option on their navigation tab, but you can find it when you scroll down the pages. Another big mistake on their menu is that it is not scannable since it's all image files, which means this can decrease in traffic since people wouldn't be able to search any of their menu.

## **Mobile Responsiveness**

### Mobile usage is rapidly increasing every year. It is important for us web developers to provide responsive mobile design and a seamless viewing experience across a wide variety of devices from desktop to smartphones.

### This website is definitely mobile friendly and almost easier to browse on a smartphone than on the desktop. The logo on the mobile page appears in black unlike the desktop so it was easier to recognize and images were compact as well. However, because their online menu is posted as an image file, it was harder to look through their menu since it was smaller than what you can see on the desktop. It was not responsive for the mobile users since you have to manually zoom in to see the menus. The hamburger menu on mobile did not clash like the one on desktop since it opens on a separate page. It is nice to see the scroll track on the mobile page, it helps to know that you can scroll down more and how much content is below.
